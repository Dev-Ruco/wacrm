/**
 * Bracketed markers `buildConversationContext` (./context.ts) uses to
 * describe past media/interactive WhatsApp messages to the model — e.g.
 * "[Opção interactiva no WhatsApp]". They exist purely so the model can
 * read its own history; a real production incident showed the model
 * echoing one back as if it were reply content, so `guardrails.ts` checks
 * output against this same list to catch that.
 *
 * Kept in its own module (not exported from context.ts) so importing it
 * from guardrails.ts doesn't pull in the rest of context.ts's surface —
 * tests that mock the `./context` module wholesale would otherwise lose
 * this list along with it.
